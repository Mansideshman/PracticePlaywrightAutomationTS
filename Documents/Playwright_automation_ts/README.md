npx playwright test tests/02_firsttest/212_Browser_context_pages.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke"

# Run tests in specific directory
npx playwright test tests/01_Basics/

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Installing New Dependencies

```bash
npm install --save-dev <package-name>
```

### Creating New Tests

1. Create test file in appropriate directory under `tests/`
2. Use descriptive names: `feature_description.spec.ts`
3. Follow existing test structure and conventions
4. Use proper TypeScript typing

Example:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('verify feature works', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const element = page.locator('[data-testid="feature"]');
  await expect(element).toBeVisible();
});
```

## 📝 Documentation

- **SETUP_COMPLETE.md** - Detailed setup and configuration guide
- **REPORTS.md** - Quick reference for running and viewing reports
- **utils/reports/README.md** - Comprehensive report documentation

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

Add to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install

- name: Run tests
  run: npm test

- name: Upload reports
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-reports
    path: utils/reports/
```

## 📋 Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Running
- Verify Node.js version: `node --version`
- Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check browser installation: `npx playwright install`

### Reports Not Generating
- Ensure tests actually run (check console output)
- Verify write permissions in `utils/reports/` directory
- Check browser support compatibility

### Permission Issues
```bash
chmod -R 755 utils/
chmod -R 755 tests/
```
